/**
 * Analyze User Website Visit Pattern
 *
 * We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
 *
 * A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.
 * (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)
 *
 * Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution,
 * return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.
 *
 *
 * Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
 * Output: ["home","about","career"]
 * Explanation:
 * The tuples in this example are:
 * ["joe", 1, "home"]
 * ["joe", 2, "about"]
 * ["joe", 3, "career"]
 * ["james", 4, "home"]
 * ["james", 5, "cart"]
 * ["james", 6, "maps"]
 * ["james", 7, "home"]
 * ["mary", 8, "home"]
 * ["mary", 9, "about"]
 * ["mary", 10, "career"]
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
 * The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
